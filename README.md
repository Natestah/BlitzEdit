# BlitzEdit

Blitz Edit, is intended to be a control library that I use in Blitz Search as well as a standalone Exectuable to be personally signed and deployed alongside Blitz Search.

# Why does the world need another text editor?

It doesn't.. 

C# does need improvements in-an around UI for Editting text, The AvaloniaEdit ( Avalonia UI ) control has made great strides from a library that I also have Experience with ( AvalonEdit ).  So this would be MY grounds to prove out contributions.

# What are the Improvements to AvaloniaEdit? 

There are a lot of Modern Text Editor convensions, with regards to raw-text editting, that I would like to contribute.  They are things like Soft-Undo, Multi-caret editting, Mini-maps.

# I still don't get it

It's ok.. 

This would be a different kind of Editor, one that Leans entirely on Blitz Search for finding stuff and being generally a quiet place for doing just text editting, No AI, No Code-Completion, No nagging. Just text edits.  When paired with Blitz Search, and Blitz Searches robust Find/Replace, It should be a pretty nifty powerfull tool to have in the box.
